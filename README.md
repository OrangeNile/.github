# Orange Nile
At Orange Nile, we are passionate about delivering high-quality software solutions using the latest technologies. We take pride in working with .NET Core and C# as our primary development framework and rely on Azure as our trusted cloud environment.

.NET Core offers numerous benefits that allow us to build advanced and versatile software applications. One of the key advantages of .NET Core is its ability to develop cross-platform applications. This means we can use the same codebase to build applications that run on different operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. This enables us to deploy your software solutions across multiple platforms and provide users with a seamless experience regardless of the platform they are using.

In addition, we work with React as our front-end framework. React is a popular JavaScript library known for its powerful capabilities in building user interfaces. By combining .NET Core with React, we can create fast, responsive, and interactive frontend experiences. This allows us to design modern and intuitive user interfaces that meet the demands of the digital world.

When it comes to hosting and infrastructure, we have chosen Azure as our cloud environment. Azure provides a wide range of services and tools that assist us in building, deploying, and scaling our applications. With Azure, we can harness the power of the cloud and benefit from reliability, scalability, and flexibility. Additionally, Azure offers comprehensive security measures to ensure the safety of your data.
